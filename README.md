Give this repository a ⭐ to support our work.

Support through TeamViewer is available for free for everyone that has persistent errors, dont offer me money because I wont accept it, AhMyth is free and open source and it will stay like that for all of eternity.

Contributions are more than welcome, as AhMyth will continue to be maintained 
until it has reached its goal of being able to provide more payload options
for multiple platforms other than just Android (i.e `.exe/.msi`, `.php` etc).
#

## <div align="center">Usage</div>

01. Build a standalone APK Payload or use an original APK as a Template
02. Install the APK Payload on the Victim Android Device
03. Take Control of the Victim Android Device with the *Victim's Lab*
#

## <div align="center">Installation</div>

#

## <div align="center">Issues</div>

Any issue regarding the AhMyth Server or the AhMyth Client, must be posted using the *[Issue Templates](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new/choose)*.
If you don't use the *Issue Templates*, please start a [Blank Issue](https://github.com/Morsmalleo/AhMyth/issues/new), and post it with enough valid information about the problem.

We work hard here to keep the *Issues Section* as clean and as understanding as possible,
so please help us to do that by using the *Issue Templates* or by providing non-template Issues with decent information.

Duplicate Issues will also be removed without question if I can see that the user was to lazy to check the closed issues.
