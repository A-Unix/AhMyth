## Hiring for further AhMyth Development
I am currently looking for an open source developer who is proficient 
in the following languages;
- Pure JavaScript (NodeJS)
- Android XML
- HTML
- CSS
- Ruby

This is for further development
of the open source AhMyth project, I don't intend on paying people for open source development either
so don't bother emailing me asking me to pay for development, this is what closed source development is for, 
closed source is paid, open source is free!

AhMyth is a powerful open-source remote administration tool that can be used to access informational data from an android device. Through it, an attacker can access critical information such as the current geographical location of the device being attacked. In advanced use cases it can be used to hack the victim’s microphone and launch recordings, get camera snapshots and also read personal messages on the attacked device.
