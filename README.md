## Windows Development Ceased
    AhMyth development for Windows machines has ceased since v1.0-beta.3, due to to many errors 
    and issues compared to that of Linux. AhMyth will now be developed and maintained for Linux 
    Machines only. This Windows sub-section of the installation section of AhMyth will be removed 
    in the next release of AhMyth Android RAT. 
    
    You will no longer find Windows Setup executables for AhMyth in versions 1.0-beta.2 & 1.0-beta.3, 
    as well as future releases of AhMyth.
<br /><br />
## Setup Packages Removed Until Further Notice
    I have removed all the AhMyth Linux.deb setup files from both versions 1.0-beta.2 & 1.0-beta.3
    due to the fact that there were errors adding the source IP was to the APK file after the .deb 
    package was installed. So they have been removed, and both versions of AhMyth are now Source code 
    ONLY to prevent anymore unwanted problems & errors until furhter research is conducted into why this
    is happening.
