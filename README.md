Give this repository a ⭐ to support our work
and please feel free to share it as much as you can.

Read the Instruction in the AhMyth Wiki before setting this up please!

I'm getting tired of people posting duplicate issues about having 
trouble setting this up or about having errors while running it.

If people would actually take the time to read up on how to set this up as well as how to use it properly using the Wiki
I created or my AhMyth videos on YouTube, you'd have no trouble with this at all!!
