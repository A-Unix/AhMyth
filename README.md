Issues
======
Any issue regarding the AhMyth Server or the AhMyth Client, must be posted using the *Issue Templates*.
If you don't use the *Issue Templates*, please start a blank non-template issue, and post it with enough valid information about the problem.

We work hard here to keep the *Issues Section* as clean and as understanding as possible,
so please help us to do that by using the *Issue Templates* or by providing non-template Issues with decent information.

Duplicate Issues will also be removed without question if I can see that the user was to lazy to check the closed issues.
