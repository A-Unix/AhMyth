# Any help on these tasks would be appreciated as I am currently the ONLY ONE working on this project

1. Fix Live Camera Preview for the Camera option in the Victims Lab, controlled by the `CameraManager.java` 
     
       CameraManager.java located @ './AhMyth-Client/app/src/main/java/ahmyth/mine/king/ahmyth/'
#
2. Integrate Video Recording for the camera option in the Victims Lab
#
3. Integrate Call Notifications for Incoming and Outgoing Calls from and to the Victim
#
4. Test AhMyth payload behaviour with & without AndroidX Libraries to determine if AndroidX helps the AhMyth client run better
#
5. Re-write AhMyth payload (remove google play services theme and activity and replace with Process Manager theme)
#
6. Rewrite the AhMyth-Client `*.java` API files for AndroidX API's as they were written for a very old API 

       AhMyth-Client '*.java files' located @ './AhMyth-Client/app/src/main/java/ahmyth/mine/king/ahmyth/' 
#
7. Find a `semantic-ui` alternative, as it is causing blocks in upgrading AhMyth's `node_modules` 
            
       Warnings when running `npm install semantic-ui@latest` stopping semantic-ui from upgrading
