# <div align="center">v1.0-beta.6 Todo List</div>

- [ ] 01: Update the AhMyth Client & Server to be able to fetch both Inbox and Outbox/Sent SMS's instead of just Inbox SMS's.
> In Progress.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 02: Update the AhMyth Client & Server so users are able to Download Directories as well as large files without disconnection.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 03: Update the `createPayloadDirectory` function to split ahmyth folders up into seperate classes folders, instead of just one.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 04: Build a seperate AhMyth Client with no activity for Binding. The smaller the payload, the more successful binding should be.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 05: Fix *xml2js* bug with the `modifyManifest` function that happens when modifying certain *AndroidManifest.xml* files.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 06: Add Client Updates from [HiddenPirates](https://github.com/HiddenPirates) for Standalone Payloads.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 07: Add *multidex* for the Standalone Client and the Binding Client.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 08: Add Side Menu for navigating main ahmyth tabs instead of having them on top.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 09: add a Settings Menu tab to the new side menu to allow users to do the following:

  - Change from Light theme to Dark Theme
  - Set Output directory for built payloads
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 10: Update AhMyth to use a higher supported version of electron - Preload.js file required!
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 11: Update the *Multiport Listener* to disconnect from specific clients on specific ports, instead of all clients on specific ports.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 12: Update the Binding Feature to set the name of the original apk we are binding to, as the name for the output payload when its being built.
<br></br>
#

- [ ] 13. Update the Binding feature to clean up and remove decompiled application folders when building & signing is successful and if errors are thrown during binding.
<br></br>

# <div align="center">v1.0-beta.7 Todo List</div>

- [ ] 01: Experiment with the following libraries to see if we can run AhMyth payload java classes dynamically in memory without the need for physical files.

Java Libraries:
1. com.squareup.javapoet.*
  - Used for code generation.

2. javax.tools.JavaCompiler
  - Part of the Java Compiler API for compiling Java code.
    
3. javax.tools.ToolProvider
  - A utility class for obtaining a JavaCompiler instance.
    
4. java.io.FileWriter
  - Used for writing to files.

5. java.lang.reflect.Method
  - Used for dynamic method invocation.


Android Libraries:

6. dalvik.system.DexClassLoader
  - Android-specific class loader for loading classes from *.dex* files.

This technique if we can manage it, should allow us to access Android hardware components such as the Camera, Microphone etc etc without actually requiring physical java/smali class files in the APK payload for it, a technique inspired by Metasplot's *Meterpreter* payload.
<br></br>

- [ ] 02: See if we can add support for *Kali NetHunter*.
