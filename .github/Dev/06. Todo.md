- [x] 01. Update the callback error message for Parsing in the `$appCtrl.modifyManifest` function and update the functions call to print these callback error messages, and also update the calls in `BindOnBoot` and `BindOnLaunch`
> Done. Needs to be Tested.
#
- [x] 02. Add a callback for the Parsing function after reading the payload manifest file in the `$appCtrl.generateApk` function appropriately so it doesnt interfere with binding.
> Done.
#
- [ ] 03. Clean up the code so it all conforms to proper *JavaScript* function naming:
- change `$appCtrl.CopyAhmythFilesAndGenerateApk` to `$appCtrl.copyAhmythFilesAndGenerateApk`
- change `BindOnLauncher` & `BindOnBoot` functions and instances to `bindOnActivity` & `bindOnBoot`
#
- [ ] 04. Update the *auotinstall_linux* file, to install AhMyth and it's dependencies for *Blackarch*.
#
- [x] 05. Wrap the code for the `payload directory creator` utilised inside the `$appCtrl.CopyAhmythFilesAndGenerateApk` function, in a function of its own so it can be called with a Callback, and give the function the name `$appCtrl.createPayloadDirectory`
> Done. Needs to be tested.
#
- [ ] 06. Create a function to check the users current Java version and prevent any process from running if the users current applied *JDK* version is anything but *JDK11*.
> In Progress
#
- [x] 07. Add a function to throw a Deprecention Warning for 32bit users stating the AhMyth will cease support for Operating Systems running 32bit architecture as soon as *Apktool* reaches *v3.0.0*.
> Done.
#
- [x] 08. Fix the bug causing the broken Binding in the Server.
> Done. Needs to be Tested.
#
- [x] 09. Fix the missing `logPath` printing for errors.
> Done.
#
- [ ] 10: Update then `$appCtrl.generateApk` function itself so that certain functions for building standalone apk payload files dont when the user is Binding, such functions would include the checkbox permissions code used in `generateApk` which is used for selected permissions for standalone payloads, and `modifyManifest` which is used when binding to modify and original apk manifest, as well as other code responsible for modifying the standalone payloads manifest file based on the ticked permissions boxes in `generateApk`
